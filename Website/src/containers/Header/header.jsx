Media often referenced a figure of 500,000 amputees, sourced from a 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) study. A more conservative estimate of 25,000 prosthetic users, factoring in affordability and limited access, stems from a 2019 report by the O&P Virtual Library. The Indian government's 2018 survey revealed a staggering 9 million individuals with mobility disabilities, underlining the significant demand for prosthetics. Despite strides, challenges like limited awareness persist, requiring collaborative efforts from government, NGOs, and the private sector to enhance affordability, innovation, and prosthetic care across the nation.</p>
